Transcribed Speech Archive Browser
==================================

This is a web-application for browsing an archive of (possibly automatically) transcribed
speech files (e.g., radio shows or lectures).

The application is described in:

Tanel Alum√§e and Ahti Kitsik. TSAB - web interface for transcribed speech collections. Interspeech 2011, Firenze, Italy. [PDF](https://phon.ioc.ee/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=people:tanel:interspeech2011.pdf)

Demo

The system is live at http://bark.phon.ioc.ee/tsab, acting as a front-end for automatically transcribed
Estonian radio shows.
