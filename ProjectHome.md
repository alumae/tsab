The Transcribed Speech Archive Browser (TSAB) serves as a web­based front end for a set of speech recordings automatically transcribed using a speech recognition system. The system
allows the end­-user to listen to the speech recordings together with time­-aligned transcripts, view the automatic transcriptions (organized by speaker), search the
transcriptions, view and listen to the search results, view recordings that are related to each other by content.

The system is not responsible for generating the automatic transcriptions for the recordings. However, it includes a command line interface that allows adding new transcribed recordings.
